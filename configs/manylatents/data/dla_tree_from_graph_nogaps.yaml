  # =========================
  # Main trunk - Data edges (stitched together, no gaps)
  # =========================
  - [1, 2, 1, 300]      # N1--E1--N2   (Main trunk start)
  - [2, 3, 2, 300]      # N2--E2--N3   (Trunk continuation)
  - [2, 8, 3, 300]      # N2--E3--N8   (stitched: was N8→N13, gap N2→N8, gap N13→N4→N5→N6)
  - [8, 6, 4, 300]      # N8--E4--N6   (stitched: connects to where gap chain ended)
  - [6, 7, 5, 100]      # N6--E5--N7   (Trunk end, subsampled)

  # =========================
  # Branch A (from N2) - Data edges (stitched)
  # =========================
  - [2, 10, 6, 300]     # N2--E6--N10  (Branch A start)
  - [10, 12, 7, 100]    # N10--E7--N12 (stitched: was N10→N11→N12, gap N10→N11 removed)

  # =========================
  # Branch B (from N6) - Data edge
  # =========================
